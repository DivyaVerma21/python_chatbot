Loops in Python
Loops are essential constructs in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. They enable automation and efficiency by eliminating the need to manually repeat code lines. Python supports two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.

1. The for Loop
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.

Syntax:
for element in sequence:
    # Code block to execute for each element
Example:

# Iterate over a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
2. The while Loop
The while loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. It's ideal when the number of iterations is unknown or based on a condition.

Syntax:

while condition:
    # Code block to execute while condition is true
Example:
# Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop
num = 1
while num <= 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1
Loop Control Statements
Python provides loop control statements to modify the behavior of loops. These include break, continue, and pass.

1. The break Statement
The break statement is used to exit the loop prematurely, regardless of whether the loop condition is true or not.

Example:
# Exit the loop when encountering the number 3
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num)
2. The continue Statement
The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration.

Example:
# Skip printing even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(num)
3. The pass Statement
The pass statement is a null operation that does nothing. It is often used as a placeholder when a statement is syntactically required but no action is desired.

Example:
# Placeholder loop
for i in range(5):
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
Nested Loops
Python allows nesting loops within each other, enabling you to create complex patterns and iterate over multidimensional data structures.

Example:
# Nested for loop to print a multiplication table
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 11):
        print(i * j, end="\t")
    print()
Conclusion
Loops are powerful constructs in Python for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures. By mastering loops and loop control statements, you can create efficient and scalable programs that handle various scenarios and data types.
