Conditional Statements in Python
Conditional statements are fundamental constructs in programming that allow the execution of different code blocks based on specific conditions. In Python, conditional statements are implemented using the if, elif (short for "else if"), and else keywords.

1. The if Statement
The if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. If the condition evaluates to true, the code block following the if statement is executed; otherwise, it is skipped.

Syntax:
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is true
Example:
# Check if a number is positive
num = 10
if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
2. The elif Statement
The elif statement allows you to check additional conditions if the preceding if statement evaluates to false. It stands for "else if" and is used to specify alternative conditions to check.

Syntax:
if condition1:
    # Code block to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # Code block to execute if condition2 is true
else:
    # Code block to execute if none of the above conditions are true
Example:
# Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
num = -5
if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
3. The else Statement
The else statement is used to execute a block of code when the preceding if and elif statements evaluate to false. It is optional and comes at the end of a series of if and elif statements.

Syntax:
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is true
else:
    # Code block to execute if condition is false
Example:
# Check if a number is even or odd
num = 7
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
Nested Conditional Statements
Conditional statements can be nested within each other to handle more complex conditions.

Example:
# Nested if-else statement
num = 10
if num >= 0:
    if num == 0:
        print("The number is zero.")
    else:
        print("The number is positive.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")
Conclusion
Conditional statements are powerful tools in Python for controlling the flow of your code based on specific conditions. By mastering conditional statements, you can create programs that make decisions and respond dynamically to different scenarios.
